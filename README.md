# 🧩 Data Structures in C

Just a bunch of classic data structures I’m implementing for fun using C. I do recreational coding in my free time, mostly to learn and mess around with lower-level stuff. Nothing too fancy here—just some clean C code and a bit of curiosity.

## 🛠️ What’s Inside

A growing list of data structures, including:

- Singly & Doubly Linked Lists
- Stacks (array & linked list)
- Queues
- Binary Search Trees
- Hash Tables
- Heaps
- Graphs

Might add more as I go along.

## 💬 Why C?

Because pointers, manual memory management, and debugging segfaults at 2AM build character.  
Also, it’s just fun to get close to the metal sometimes.
